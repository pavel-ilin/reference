    "Deep neural networks are trained by **learning** a set of weights. The optimal weights are learned by **minimizing the loss function** for the neural network. This minimization is performed using an **optimization algorithm**. Thus, optimization algorithms are an essential component in your neural network tool box.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson you will become familiar with the basic optimization algorithms used to train deep neural networks, along with their pitfalls. The nonlinear nature of neural networks leads to several serious problems with local gradients. As a result of the multiple nonlinearities the local gradient can exhibit complex behavior. Further, the local gradient can be quite different from the larger-scale global behavior of the loss function gradient. \n",

    "The high dimensionality of the neural network training optimization problems makes detailed understanding of optimization behavior extremely difficult. There is one dimension for each model weight (parameter). Thus, the optimization is performed over a non-linear surface with millions of dimensions. Despite several decades of research, much of the measurable progress has been based on empirical experience rather than theory.   \n"

    "Some common pitfalls of deep neural network loss functions are **vanishing gradients** and **exploding gradients**. Vanishing gradients arise when multiple small gradients are encountered in backpropagation. Exploding gradients arise when rapid changes in the loss function, sometimes referred to as **cliffs**, are encountered in the loss function.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A deep linear model analogy can aid in understanding vanishing gradients. In this simple model each layer has the same weights, represented by the tensor $W$. We can compute an eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition of $W$:\n",

The net effect is that gradients from deep in the networks can be exponentially smaller than from shallow layers. When the backpropagation is applied, the gradient effectively vanishes toward 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exploding gradients arise from sudden changes in curvature of the loss function. Encountering these 'cliffs' results in a gradient descent algorithm overshooting the minimum point, sometimes by an extreme amount. The Hessian represents the curvature of the loss function or the rate of change of the gradient. The eigen-decomposition of the Hessian:\n",

The Hessian has a small condition number. At the next step the eigenvalues can become enormous (much greater than 1), since the curvature of the loss function is changing so rapidly. Since only some eigenvalues grow large, the condition number becomes extremely large.  This leads to the exploding gradient! \n",

For example, the gradient may decrease and then increase again. In these cases, a constant learning rate results in slow convergence. There are several possible approaches to changing learning rates of optimization algorithms. \n",

This approach is effective in cases where the gradient decreases fairly steadily as the optimization proceeds. The lower learning rate reduces the chance that the algorithm over-shoots the optimum point and then wanders around with slow convergence. We have seen this behavior in the foregoing SGD examples.    \n",

The learning rate should decrease when the gradient of the loss function is better behaved. In practice, these ideals are hard to achieve and researchers have created many algorithms using various heuristics to adapt learning rate. "
