    "## 1.0 Why do we need regularization for deep learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models have a great many parameters (weights) which must be fit. This situation arises from the wide and deep architectures that are required to achieve significant **model capacity** for representing complex functions. The core issue is that over-fit models will simply learn the training data and **over-fit models do not generalize**. Therefore, regularization methods are required in order to prevent over-fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we can point to three interrelated problems with training deep neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Neural network models have large numbers of parameters (weights). With any finite size data set, there is likely to be a low ratio of cases per parameter or low ratio of cases to features. \n",
    "2. As a result of the large numbers of parameters, neural networks are susceptible to noise in the training data. Neural networks are generally considered less robust to noise than shallow machine learning methods. \n",
    "3. Presumably as a result of the model complexity, neural networks often return unexpected predictions for data cases outside the training data domain. This property has been referred to as **brittleness**. Brittleness has proven to be a serious problem in some production systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "The regularization methods presented here will limit these effects. However, there is no 'silver bullet'! Neural networks are hard to train under the best of circumstances. "

    "The same method goes by some other names, as it has been 'invented' several times. In particular, this method is known as, **Tikhonov regularization**, **l2 norm regularization**, **pre-whitening** in engineering, and for linear models **ridge regression**. In all likelihood the method was first developed by the Russian mathematician Andrey Tikhonov in the late 1940's. His work was not widely known in the West since his short book on the subject, [Solution of Ill-Posed Problems](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44438630_Solutions_of_ill-posed_problems_Andrey_N_Tikhonov_and_Vasiliy_Y_Arsenin), was only published in English in 1977, about 30 years after it had appeared in Russian.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is the basic idea? l2 regularization applies a **penalty** proportional to the **l2** or **Euclidean norm** of the model weights to the loss function. The total loss function then becomes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$J(W) = J_{MLE}(W) + \\lambda ||W||^2$$\n",

    "You can think of this penalty as constraining the 12 or Euclidean norm of the model weight vector.

The basic idea is simple. A batch normalization layer maintains an exponential moving average estimate of the mean and variance of the outputs of layer. These values are used to normalize the output values of that layer. In other words, the batch normalization layer ensures the distribution of the output values are constant. \n",
