# LOOKIN' FOR ADVENTURE - HEAD OUT ON THE HIGHWAY

Word has just come from the higher-ups, and you're in charge of building out a domain that keeps track of cars, their owners, and the mechanics that service them.  Each car has its own classification, like "antique", "exotic", or "clunker", and each mechanic has a specialization (these are the same as car classifications).  You don't want to take your sweet souped up '94 Camaro to some jerk that specializes in beamers right?

Each CarOwner may have a ton of cars, but these folks are fanatical about their maintenance, and only see one mechanic per car.

The basics have been built out for you, but you'll need to figure out the relationships and create most of the methods.  Hook it up!
